are like living organisms. They consist of a number of subsystems, each of which performs a vital specialized function that makes specific, unique, and essential contributions to the life of the whole. A given individual subsystem is devoted to its own specific function such as design, production, management, maintenance, sales, procurement, and adaptability. One cannot carry the biological analogy very far because living organisms separate subsystems with physical boundaries and structures (e.g., cell walls, the nervous system, the digestive system, the circulatory system, etc.). Boundaries and structure of subsystems in human organizations, on the other hand, are not physical; they are repetitive events, activities, and transactions. The repetitive patterns of activities are, in effect, the work tasks, procedures, and processes carried out by organizational functions. Open systems theorists call these patterns of activities roles. A role consists of one or more recurrent activities out of a\\ntotal pattern of activities which, in combination, produce the organizational output. Roles are maintained and carried out in a repetitive, relatively stable manner by means of mutually understood sets of expectations and feedback loops.\\n\\nThe Triple Role Open Systems theory and Juran’s model focuses particularly on the technical methods, human relationships, organization structures, and interdependence of functional roles associated with these activities and transactions. Detailed knowledge of the repetitive transactions between the organization and its environment, and also within the organization\\nitself, is essential in accomplishing breakthroughs because these transactions determine the effectiveness and efficiency of performance.\\n\\nThe triple role is a model that applies equally to an organization as a whole, to individual subsystems and organizational functions (e.g., departments and workstations within the organization, and to individual organizational members performing tasks in any function or level. All these entities perform three more or less simultaneous roles, acting as supplier, processor, and customer. Acting as a processor, charged with the duty of transforming imported energy, organizations receive raw materials-goods, information, and/or services- from their suppliers, who may be located inside or outside the organization. The processor’s job consists of transforming the received things into a new product of some kind-goods, information, or service. In turn, the processor supplies the product to his or her customers who may be located within or outside the organization. Each of these roles requires more than merely the exchange of things. Each role is linked by mutually understood expectations (i.e., specifications, work orders, and procedures) and feedback as to how well the expectations are being met (i.e., complaints, quality reports, praise, and rewards). In addition, the processor provides the supplier with feedback on the extent to which the \\nexpectations are being met. This feedback is part of the control loop and helps to ensure consistent adequate performance by the supplier. The customer bears the same responsibilities to his or her processors who, in effect, are also suppliers (not of the raw materials but of the product).\\n\\nWhen defects, delays, errors, or excessive costs occur, causes can be found somewhere in the activities performed by suppliers, processors, and customers, in the set of transactions between them, or perhaps in gaps in the communication of needs and feedback. Breakthrough efforts must uncover the precise root causes by deep probing and exploration. If the causes are really elusive, discovering them may require placing the offending repetitive process under a microscope of unprecedented power and precision, as is done in Six Sigma. Performance excellence initiatives require that all functions and levels be involved, at least to some extent, because each function’s performance is interrelated and dependent to some degree on all other functions. Moreover, a change in the behavior of any one function will have some effect on all the others, even though it may not be apparent at the time. This interrelatedness of all functions has practical day-to-day implications for a leader at any level, that is, the imperative of using “systems thinking” when making decisions, particularly decisions to make changes. Because an organization is an open system, its life depends on (1) successful transactions with the organization’s external environment and (2) proper coordination of the organization’s various specialized internal functions and their outputs.\\n\\nThe proper coordination and performance of the various internal functions is dependent on the management processes of planning, controlling, and improving and on human factors such as leadership, organizational structure, and culture. To manage in an open system (such as an organization), management at all levels must think and act in systems terms. Managers must consider the impact of any proposed change not only upon the whole organization but also the impact on the interrelationships of all the parts. Failure to do so, even when changing seemingly little things, can make some pretty big messes. Leaders need to\\nreason as follows: “If there is to be a change in x, what is required (inputs) from all functions to create this change, and how will x affect each of the other functions, and the total organization as well (ultimate output/results)?” Organizations will not change until the people in them change, regardless of the breakthrough approach.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":142}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":288,"height":3088,"strokewidth":0}},"width":288,"height":3088,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"5s13zT71jBt"}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":384,"yPos":158,"tabIndex":5,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":160,"rotateYPos":184,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":6,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"html5data":{"url":"","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":320,"height":368,"strokewidth":0}},"width":320,"height":368,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"background":{"type":"vector","vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":320,"bottom":368,"altText":"Scroll 1","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":141}}},"id":"5WpTJOxeG8j"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
