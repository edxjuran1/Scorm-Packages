Juran presented at the 1990 “Quest for Excellence” conference featuring the 1989 winners of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. While this was presented a long time ago, the concepts and lessons presented are still applicable today. \\n\\nResults Achieved\\nLet us start with the achievements reported during these two days by the Baldrige Award companies. The Reported Results are Stunning. The most visible feature of those achievements is their stunning magnitude. When our economists debate their forecasts of gains in national productivity they are talking of a few percent a year. The achieved gains of the Baldrige winners have been far greater. Their reports include numerous cases in which during a few years:\\nThe time to provide customer service has been reduced by an order of magnitude\\nDefect levels have been reduced by an order of magnitude\\nProductivity has doubled\\nCosts have been cut by 50^%^\\nThose are indeed stunning results.\\nResults Across the Entire Spectrum. The second notable feature of the achievements is that the improvements took place throughout the entire spectrum of company activities: customer satisfaction; field performance of products; quality of the manufacturing processes; suppliers’ quality; timeliness of customer service; quality of business processes; employee safety. To use the latest terminology, these companies have replaced the traditional focus on so-called little Q with the concept of Big Q.\\nGains Beyond the Measurables. Thirdly, we should notice that the companies made extensive gains beyond the measurable results. For example, as a by-product of making all those improvements, their personnel have become experienced at making improvements, and have gotten into the habit of making improvements. In addition, most of these improvements were made by teams. That requires teamwork. The exhilaration of being on winning teams then carries over into the traditional responsibilities as well. We all know that members of a winning team fight with the competition, but members of a losing team fight with each other.\\nHow they Got Such Results\\nNext let us look at how the Baldrige winners got such results-what they did that was different from their previous practice. \\nStretch Goals. One obvious difference is that the companies established “stretch goals” – goals such as:\\nMilliken’s tenfold quality improvement in four years\\nXerox’s four times improvement in reliabilitry\\nXerox’s reduction of 12 months in the product development cycle\\nMotorola’s Six Sigma\\nSuch quality goals cannot be met by the pedestrian pace of the ordinary learning curve. Something extraordinary is needed to meet those stretch goals. What was the nature of that something extraordinary?\\nBenchmarking. The typical reaction to stretch goals is that they cannot be met. One way to deal with this reaction is to use the concept of benchmarking as championed by Xerox. Benchmarking involves setting goals based on results already achieved by world leaders in similar activities. Those goals are not limited to the product results. They extend to the processes which made those results possible. The fact that someone has gotten those results proves that it is doable. Similarly, the fact that the Baldrige winners have already met stretch goals proves that it is doable.\\nQuality Improvement at a Revolutionary Pace. To meet stretch goals, the major form of “what to do different” consists of going into quality improvement at a revolutionary pace. The Baldrige winners did just that. Milliken reported that over 200,000 opportunities for improvement were implemented during 1989. Milliken also reported thousands of projects completed by action teams during 1989. Xerox reported that 75^%^ of employees were serving on manufacturing teams during 1990.\\nResources. Those achieved results did not come free-they were a return on resources. A major category of those resources provided the infrastructure without which there would be few improvements. Let me note here that to make improvements by the thousands requires quite an organized effort-an infrastructure. A process is needed for choosing the projects to be tackled. Teams must be organized and assigned to carry out the projects. The teams must be provided with the a well designed process for making improvements. The teams need to be trained in how to operate as teams, as well as in how to diagnose problems and provide remedies. Each improvement project requires multiple team meetings, and much homework between meetings. A review process is needed to monitor progress and to help teams which get stuck. Collectively it is a lot of work, and it requires corresponding resources. \\nLet us note here Mr. Robert Galvin’s point that his company’s publicizing the shockingly high cost of poor quality resulted in some quality improvements without up-front investment. I have witnessed the same phenomenon in other companies-the shock caused some managers to shift priorities. However, those same companies then used some of the resulting benefits to invest in training, team building, etc.\\nTraining. Extensive training was provided by the companies. That also required resources. Xerox has described its training strategy and the associated training curricula. Notice that the strategy featured starting at the top then cascading down. Milliken also described its approach to training, and gave a figure of $1,900 per associate during 1989. As could be expected, the approaches of the two companies differed. However, both companies faced up to providing the resources needed for training-resources which were substantial.\\nEmployee Involvement. All Baldrige winners have used employee involvement to an unprecedented degree. The major change was to provide employees with the opportunity to participate in quality planning and improvement. Use of teams was widespread. There were many types of teams, and they worked on projects which expanded across the entire spectrum of company activities-Big Q. Of particular interest was the emerging phenomenon of self-supervising worker teams. I will later return to that phenomenon-all of us should keep an eye on it.\\nMotivation. All the companies have stressed the use of motivation as a means of changing the culture and securing employee involvement. A major form of that motivation has been recognized-public acknowledgement of the contributions made by individuals and teams. Milliken reported an extraordinary reate of such recognitions during 1988, reaching five out of every six production “associates.”\\nRelative to motivation for quality improvement we should notice an essential yet subtle change which must take place. We have always had quality improvements, but they have been at a pedestrian pace. The main reason for that pace has been the voluntary nature of improvement. For line operating personnel, improvement was not a part of the regular job. The regular job consisted of control-meeting the schedule, the budget, the quality specification, etc. Improvement was something incidental to the regular job-it was not a part of the operating employee’s job description. \\nTo achieve improvement at a revolutionary pace requires that improvement be made mandatory-that it become a part of the regular job., written into the job description. Our feedback from many companies tells us that this is a profound change in culture, and that it encounters a good deal of cultural resistance. Those who have yet to make this change are well advised to examine the nature of that cultural resistance.\\nLeadership From the Top. For all Baldrige winners the top managers personally and actively supplied the leadership for the revolution in quality. You heard from the top manages in four Award winning companies. Did they leave any doubt as to who were the leaders in their quality revolution? The top managers personally participated in providing the prerequisite essentials of the kind set out in Dr. Malone’s list:\\nCreate the vision\\nEstablish objectives\\nDevelop the game plan\\nProvide the tools\\nForm the teams\\nEducation and training\\nCreate the environment\\nSuch personal participation is in refreshing contrast to an approach which was very popular during the 1980s. Under that approach, many top managers established vague goals:\\nQuality has top priority\\nDo it right the first time\\nThey then used exhortation methods-slogans, posters and the colorful rest-to urge their subordinates to meet those vague goals. \\nIn most companies such an approach was doomed to failure. Those vague goals were not supported by the necessary infrastructure, and certainly not by the personal and continuing leadership of top managers. Lacking the essential support, the vague goals could not possibly compete with the traditional, clear goals of meeting the schedules, budgets, and so on, which did have the personal and continuing leadership of the top managers. The lesson is that for a revolutionary change, or a change in culture, the job of leadership is not delegable. Those top managers who missed that lesson spent much of the 1980s on a road which led nowhere. In the minds of many of their subordinates, the top managers were not leading-they were only cheerleading.\\nLessons Learned\\nLet me now turn to the lessons to be learned from the experience of these Baldrige Winners. \\nAll participants at this conference came to learn from the experience of those who are Baldrige Award winners. In the process of reaching that status, the winners achieved some enviable results-the very kind of results which everyone in this room would like to have. \\nWhatever the winners did to get those results, the fact that they did so proves that it was doable. However, to learn from their experience requires a transfer of know-how. Such a transfer of know-how should not be done by mimicking what the winners did. Mimicking is risky because of differences in the respective cultures. A reliable transfer of know-how requires thinking through what are the lessons learned-what are the universal concepts and processes which made those winning results possible. It is the universals which are transferable from one culture to another. \\nWhat now follows is a list of lessons learned from the presentations made at this conference. Here and there I will supplement this list with lessons learned from the experiences of additional companies.\\nEstablish Stretch Goals. The first lesson learned is that stretch goals can be met. The fact that the Baldrige winners met stretch goals proves that it is doable. \\nA subsidiary lesson is to use benchmarking as an aid to establishing goals. \\nAs a corollary, stretch goals cannot be met by the pedestrian pace of the ordinary learning curve. Something extraordinary is needed to meet stretch goals.\\nAdopt the Concept of Big Q. The term Big Q is a label for the enlarged scope of managing for quality. Under the principal feature of that enlargement:\\nThe word “product” includes services as well as goods. That is also the economists’ definition.\\nThe word “process” includes business processes well as production processes.\\nThe word “customer” includes all who are impacted, internal as well as external.\\nThe trend to adoption of the Big Q concept is growing, and is probably irreversible.\\nLet me here add an observation relative to business processes and other multifunctional processes. There is an inherent conflict between the functional organization and multifunctional processes. Functional organization consists of vertical hierarchies. However, things get done through the horizontal multifunctional processes. Those processes extend beyond the boundaries of the company-they include customers and suppliers. All this requires a new look at a widely neglected problem-the ownership of the multifunctional processes. Some useful pioneering work has been done in this area by IBM. However, for most of industry this is a huge opportunity waiting to be tackled.\\nCreate the infrastructure for Improvement. To meet stretch goals requires making improvements in unprecedented numbers. In turn, to make all those improvements requires an infrastructure. We have already noted the elements of that infrastructure:\\nA high level council to guide the approach.\\nA process for selecting the projects to be tackled.\\nA process for appointing teams to tackle the projects. Most of the important projects are multifunctional in nature, and thereby require a team approach.\\nTraining the teams in how to work as teams, and in how to diagnose and remedy problems. I might note here that this type of training should be directed at changing behavior. Training in how to make improvements should focus on actual improvement projects, and the training should be designed to help the teams complete those projects. During the 1980s much of our training was educational in nature, and hence was soon forgotten.\\nReview of progress by upper managers. The work of making improvements is constantly competing with the work of control - the job of meeting sales quotas, schedules and other traditional goals. To keep that competition in balance, the upper managers must review progress on improvement as well as progress on meeting the traditional goals. You may recall that the Milliken speakers told us that every four weeks their upper management spends four and a half hours just on quality, and that this review is non-cancelable.\\nGive recognition. We saw extensive use of that concept in the presentations. \\nUpdate the reward system. Participating in all those improvement projects adds substantially to the work load of the entire hierarchy of managers and team members. This new work is mandated – it becomes part of the job description. As a result, the reward system must be updated to take into account the added responsibilities.\\nLet me here point out that the recognition system and the reward system usually serve different purposes. Recognition is usually for the purpose of publicly acknowledging outstanding performance. There is also an implication that the outstanding part of the performance was voluntary on the part of the employee. In contrast, the reward system relates to the mandated work implied in the basic employment contract, of which the job description is a part.\\nIt is a Lot of Work. Whoever wants those stunning results should at the outset face up to the fact that it adds substantially to the workloads of the participating personnel, including the upper managers. The estimates vary, but none go below 10 percent. (Some Baldrige winners believe the figure is much higher.) Failure to face up to this fact has doomed many well-intended efforts.\\nOf course, the added work of making improvements is a form of investment to secure those stunning results. In the case of the Baldrige winners the investment paid off, handsomely. That same potential is there for any company, but of course the potential will be realized only if the approach is well managed. That brings us back to the role of the upper managers.\\nUpper Managers Must Lead, Personally. Observing many companies in action, I am unable to point to a single instance in which stunning results were gotten without the active and personal leadership of the upper managers. In contrast, in the successful companies the upper managers virtually took charge of quality. They did so by adopting the principle that certain aspects of the approach are not delegable. We listed some of those aspects earlier, but we can restate them here:\\nApprove the quality goals\\nSet up the infrastructure\\nProvide the resources\\nReview progress\\nProvide recognition\\nRevise the reward system\\nIn effect, the successful upper managers enlarged the business plan to include quality goals. If I read the signs correctly, that is another irreversible trend. During this decade we will see many companies enlarge their business plan to include quality goals.\\nReplace the Taylor System. A further observation on lessons learned relates to the use of the human resources. Most of our companies still retain a considerable residue of the Taylor system of separating planning from execution. That system evolved about a century ago. Its major premise was that the supervisors and workers of that era lacked the education needed to plan how work should be done. Hence the planning was turned over to engineers. The supervisors and workers were left with the responsibility of carrying out the plans. During our century education levels have increased sharply, and have thereby destroyed the major premise of the Taylor system. We are mostly agreed that the system has become obsolete, and that it should be replaced by something else. However, despite much recent experimenting we are still not agreed on what should be that something else. Meanwhile we are failing to make use of our biggest underemployed asset- the education, experience and creativity of the work force.\\nThe reports we have heard at this conference included reference to use of self-supervising teams. If I may be permitted another look into my fallible crystal ball, I suggest that self-supervising worker teams will become the dominant successor to the Taylor system.\\nImplications for the Nineties and Beyond. Finally, in the light of the proceedings at this conference, let me share with you some observations on the implications for the decade of the nineties and beyond. To do so, I will first look back at the scenario which was played out in Japan following World War II.\\nThe Japanese quality crisis was much worse than ours. For many years their principal companies had served the military machine. The quality of the weaponry turned out by those companies was competitive. In 1905 those weapons sank the Russian navy. During World War II those weapons did plenty of damage. However, at the end of the war these major companies lost their principal customer and were faced with a major crisis.\\nIt was essential to convert to civilian products. That meant deciding what to make, learning what were the market needs, and learning how to make and sell the products. All this had to be done in the face of a poor national reputation for quality which had meanwhile been created by the lesser companies.\\nTo meet that crisis the Japanese did many things, but in my view there were three major success factors:\\nThe upper managers took charge of solving the quality crisis.\\nThey undertook to train the entire managerial hierarchy in how to manage for quality, starting at the top.\\nThey undertook quality improvement at a revolutionary pace.\\nThat list of Japanese success factors is my personal opinion, but I can speak with some authority here, since I have long been a close observer of their quality revolution, and a participant as well. In the early 1950s I brought them the seed training courses in managing for quality. I also urged them to get into quality improvement at a revolutionary rate.\\nHere in the USA we were late in recognizing that a quality crisis was brewing up. In addition we lost some years while we were collecting our wits and testing out various responses. However, the last decade has provided us with the demonstration case examples. A number of American companies - Baldrige Award winners and others - have demonstrated that meeting the quality challenge is doable. How they did it, and what are the lessons learned has been the subject of this conference.\\nWhat now lies ahead of us is to apply those lessons learned across the entire economy. That is a massive job of scaling up. But we now know that it is doable, and we can be confident that we have learned what are the success factors.\\nIt is time for the media and others to stop regarding our situation as a fate. Our situation is a problem, and we have shown that we can solve it.\\nIn scaling up we must also provide training to certain vital organs of our society. An example is our legislators right here in Washington. Let me relate a recent experience.\\nLast November, on the day of the Award ceremony, I was introduced to the chairman of one of the Congressional committees which has some cognizance in this field. Our discussion led me to offer to come to Washington and give him, his committee and his staffers a briefing on the subject. He accepted that offer, and the briefing took place shortly thereafter. However, we need such briefings on a massive scale, not only for our legislators, but also for many members of the administration, and still others. In that connection, let me here declare publicly my willingness to give a briefing for yet another Congressional committee, on a pro bono publico basis.\\nThe National Quality Award is a new force which has come over the horizon. In two short years it has grown in stature and in influence to a degree unprecedented in my experience in this field, and that dates back to 1924.\\nThe Award already has the potential to become the rallying point for US industry.\\nFor the first time since the quality crisis descended on us, I have become optimistic.
