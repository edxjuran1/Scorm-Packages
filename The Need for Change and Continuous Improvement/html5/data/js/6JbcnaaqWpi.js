It is often used to describe the term a customer uses when they like something they tried or purchased. It is a word that is used synonymously with an organization’s mission—to provide superior quality to customers and stakeholders. It is also a word used to describe many methods to improve business performance. A brief look at history will help better understand where quality management is today and where it may be headed tomorrow.\\r\\nPractitioners are urged to learn about the different approaches to quality, choose the best methods to fit your business needs, and then customize the framework for your own organizations. We will refer to examples of the most popular frameworks such as the U.S. Malcolm Baldrige National Award for Excellence (and all similar frameworks around the globe) and the ISO Quality Management System to name a few.\\r\\nTwo dramatic examples illustrate how quality has an impact on both sales revenue and costs. First, two examples of poor quality. An international organization that claimed to have strong customer service refused to accept sales orders for delivery in less than 48 hours—even though competitors honored delivery requests of 24 hours. Imagine the millions of dollars of sales revenue lost each year because this company did not recognize the need of its customers. Second, listen to the president of a specialty manufacturing company: “Our scrap and rework costs this year were five times our profit. Because of those costs, we have had to increase our selling price and we subsequently lost market share. Quality is no longer a technical issue; it is a business issue.” Samsung Electronics used quality as a mantra, as a method to attain $1.6 billion in savings by focusing on improving the quality of flat-screen TV sets, making them the best practice globally. Everyone knows about Toyota quality. Why? Because its products have a reputation of being the best.\\r\\nThere are many stories like this. The conclusion is the same. If an organization focuses on the relentless pursuit of quality, it will attain a sustainable business performance and positive global reputation. Our forefathers knew—as we know—that quality is important. Metrology, specifications, inspection—all go back many centuries.\\r\\nThen came the twentieth century. The pace quickened with a lengthy procession of “new” activities and ideas launched under a bewildering array of names: quality control, continuous quality improvement, defect prevention, statistical process control, reliability engineering, quality cost analysis, zero defects, total quality management, supplier certification, quality circles, quality audit, quality assurance, quality function deployment, Taguchi methods, competitive benchmarking, Lean and Six Sigma. \\n\\nFollowing World War II, two major forces emerged that have had a profound impact on quality. The first force was the Japanese revolution in quality. Prior to World War II, many Japanese products were perceived, throughout the world, as of poor quality. To help sell their products in international markets, the Japanese took some revolutionary steps to improve quality:\\nUpper level managers personally took charge of leading the revolution.\\nAll levels and functions received training in the quality disciplines.\\nQuality improvement projects were undertaken on a continuing basis—at a revolutionary pace.\\n\\nThe Japanese success has been almost legendary. The second major force to affect quality was the prominence of product quality in the public mind. Several trends converged to highlight this prominence: product liability cases; \\nconcern about the environment; some major disasters and near disasters; pressure by consumer organizations; and the awareness of the role of quality in trade, weapons, and other areas of international competition. This emphasis on quality has been further accented by the emergence of national awards such as the Baldrige and European Quality Awards.\\r\\nQuality is not limited to the manufacturing sector. Quality concepts are applied to other sectors such as health care, education, not-for-profit organizations, and governments. Product quality is not the only focus. Service quality, process quality, and data quality are now being measured, controlled, and improved.\\r\\nDuring the twentieth century, a significant body of knowledge emerged on achieving superior quality. Many individuals contributed to this knowledge, and five names deserve particular mention: Juran, Deming, Feigenbaum, Crosby, and Ishikawa.\\n\\nJ. M. Juran emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach using managerial, statistical, and technological concepts of quality. He recommends an operational framework of three quality processes, quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement. \\r\\nW. Edwards Deming also had a broad view of quality, which he initially summarized in 14 points aimed at the management of an organization. These 14 points rest on a system of “profound knowledge” that has four parts: the systems approach, understanding of statistical variation, the nature and scope of knowledge, and psychology to understand human behavior.\\r\\nA. V. Feigenbaum emphasizes the concept of total quality control throughout all functions of an organization. Total quality control really means both planning and control. He urges creating a quality system to provide technical and managerial procedures that ensure customer satisfaction and an economical cost of quality.\\r\\nPhilip Crosby defines quality strictly as “conformance to requirements” and stresses that the only performance standard is zero defects. His activities demonstrated that all levels of employees can be motivated to pursue improvement but that motivation will not succeed unless tools are provided to show people how to improve.\\r\\nKaoru Ishikawa showed the Japanese how to integrate the many tools of quality improvement, particularly the simpler tools of analysis and problem solving. \\r\\nThe approaches of these gurus have similarities as well as differences—particularly in the relative emphasis on managerial, statistical, technological, and behavioral elements. \\n\\nJuran (1995) provides a comprehensive history of managing for quality for different time spans (ancient, medieval, modern), geographical areas, products, and political systems. \\n\\nThe major forces affecting managing for quality led to a changing set of business conditions.\\r\\nWatson (2016) states that the true meaning of quality is much deeper and broader than these specific definitions imply. What is most salient about quality is the purpose for which it is pursued. What does this mean? What is the “objective function” of quality efforts? Quality is the persistent pursuit of goodness coupled tightly with a simultaneous relentless avoidance of badness.\\r\\nAll of the above definitions are useful to understanding how to manage quality. However, the most important definition of quality is what your customers mean by it. Quality is defined by your customers. \\n\\nThis article was originally published as ”Why Quality Management?
