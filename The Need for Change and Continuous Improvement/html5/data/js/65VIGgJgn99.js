Decision to Add Service Features\\n\\nYou have decided to have a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) installed in your home to record your favorite television shows and movies for viewing later. You called a local cable provider who said: \\n\\n“Sure, you can do that. You have two options; you could wait to have the equipment sent to you through the mail, or if you would like it sooner, you can go to your local service center to pick it up.”\\n\\nThe second season of your new favorite series was premiering in a few days, so you decided to drive five miles to the service center before they closed. The representative processed your request and gave you the DVR to take home and install. He also provided you with instructions for installation. While the instructions were not easy to follow, you were able to connect the device. You then called the cable company as instructed to activate the DVR. You went through several voice prompts to get to the right person. The Service rep processed the activation and told you to wait five  minutes for the DVR to reboot and it should then begin working.\\n\\nSupport Services Kick Into Action\\n\\nAfter ten minutes the DVR was still not working so you called the cable company back again. Five minutes of the same series of voice prompts finally got you to technical support. They said they would try again and placed you on hold for six minutes. When they returned to the call, they told you that they were having problems and they put you on hold again. You stayed on hold for five minutes, and  were told that the DVR service had not\\nbeen properly set up on your account, and that you needed to talk to someone in the Billing Department to take care of this. \\n\\nYou were transferred and put on hold, waiting in the queue for nine minutes until a billing rep answered the phone. After providing your name, address, and contact info, you explained your situation. The rep told you that DVR service should have been added to your account when you picked up the DVR. \\n\\nYou were again placed on hold and waited for six minutes. The billing rep came back on the line and said they were having trouble setting up your service. They asked if you were sure you had the correct device and asked that you provide the serial number on the device. \\n\\nSince there were four different types of serial numbers, it took a while to locate the one the rep was looking for. The rep told you to read the one that began with the letters XBA. You were placed on hold again. \\n\\nAfter a couple of minutes, you noticed that your cell phone battery was getting low and that you were at risk of losing your phone connection. After waiting anxiously for three more minutes your phone shut down and disconnected. \\n\\nYou waited 15 minutes to see if the billing rep would call you back. When this did not happen, you began the process again. You called the activation number, went through prompts, got a “live person” and got them to transfer you to the billing office. You waited in queue another eight minutes. \\n\\nYou again explained your situation. You had the serial number ready to read this time. The rep put you on hold and returned four minutes later and explained that they had entered the wrong number in your account, but now they had it straightened out and that the DVR service was added to your account.\\n\\nAt this point you were  transferred back to a technical support person to activate the device. You were on hold for four minutes. \\n\\nWhen the tech support person came on the line, you explained the scenario. This person then processed the DVR equipment activation and said they would stay on the line with you until the service was active. After six minutes, the DVR came to life and you were all set up. \\n\\nGlad to finally have the device active, you then discovered you had no instructions for using the DVR device. You searched online and found a 116 page PDF of the DVR operating instructions. You printed the file and began learning how to record and watch programs.\\n\\nOvercharged\\n\\nFour weeks later, you got your next cable bill. To your surprise, you discover that you had been billed for two DVR devices instead of one! After several phone calls and wasted time on hold, you finally got it straightened out.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":183}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":305,"height":2436,"strokewidth":0}},"width":304,"height":2435,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6q4h6b2bjTX"}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":376,"yPos":126,"tabIndex":6,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":164,"rotateYPos":200,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":6,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"html5data":{"url":"","xPos":376,"yPos":126,"width":328,"height":400,"strokewidth":0}},"width":328,"height":400,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"background":{"type":"vector","vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":328,"bottom":400,"altText":"Scroll 1","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":182}}},"id":"601zVRIotoc"},{"kind":"vectorshape","rotation":0,"accType":"image","cliptobounds":false,"defaultAction":"","imagelib":[{"kind":"imagedata","assetId":40,"id":"01","url":"story_content/6Z8dwj4Om0k_80_DX608_DY608.jpg","type":"normal","altText":"Picture 2","width":340,"height":249,"mobiledx":0,"mobiledy":0}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":56,"yPos":132,"tabIndex":7,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":152,"rotateYPos":93,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"depth":7,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":304,"bottom":186,"altText":"Picture 2","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":185}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":304,"height":186,"strokewidth":0}},"width":304,"height":186,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"64y7kmIx8Bm"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
