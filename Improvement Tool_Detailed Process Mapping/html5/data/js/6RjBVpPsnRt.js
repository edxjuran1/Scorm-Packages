a large wall with butcher paper.\\nDiscuss the purpose of the process map with the team.\\nDecide on the desired outcomes. What level of detail is desired?\\nDefine the boundaries of the process. The best way to do this is to decide on the first and last steps of your process map.\\nThe first step is the answer to the question: “What signals you to begin the process?”\\nThe last step must answer the question: “How do you know that the process is complete?” Another way to think about this is to state the last step in terms of process output or goals for the process.\\nWrite a brief description of the first step on the butcher paper and secure it at the top center or left-hand edge of the wall.\\nPut the last step at the bottom center or right-hand edge of the wall.\\nDocument each step in sequence, starting with the first step. The following set of questions will help guide the discussion.\\nAre there any significant inputs associated with this step, such as database information, written information, etc.? Show these inputs using appropriate process mapping symbols.\\nDoes this step result in any significant output, such as a report? Show these outputs using appropriate process mapping symbols.\\nWhen the step is completed, what is the very next activity? Show this as the next step on the process map using appropriate symbols.\\nWhen you encounter a decision, choose one branch and continue process mapping. Be sure to describe the decision inside the symbol in the form of a question and make a notation to describe the path coming out of the decision symbol: Yes, No, etc.\\nIf you encounter a segment of the process that is unfamiliar to everyone in the room, make a note and continue process mapping. The team can go back and get the details of these steps later through direct observation or by interviewing knowledgeable people.\\nGo back and process map the other branches from the decision symbol.\\nReview the completed diagram to see if you have missed any decision points or special cases that might cause some work to follow a different process.\\nDiscuss how the team will fill in the unfamiliar steps and verify the accuracy of the process map.
