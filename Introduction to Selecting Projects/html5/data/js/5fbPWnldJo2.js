Joseph M. Juran\\nMost projects are chosen through the nomination and selection process, involving several steps:\\n\\tProject nomination \\n\\tProject screening and selection \\n\\tPreparation and publication of project goal statements \\nSources of Nominations \\nNominations for projects can come from all levels of the organization. At the higher levels, the nominations tend to be extensive in size (the vital few) and multifunctional in their scope. At lower levels, the nominations are smaller in size (the useful many) and tend to be limited in scope to the boundaries of a single department. \\nNominations come from many sources. These include \\n\\tFormal data systems, such as field reports on product performance, customer complaints, claims, returns, and so on; accounting reports on warranty charges and on internal costs of poor quality; and service call reports. (Some of these data systems provide for analyzing the data to identify problem areas.) \\n\\tSpecial studies, such as customer surveys, employee surveys, audits, assessments, benchmarking against competitors, and so on. \\n\\tReactions from customers who have run into product dissatisfactions are often vocal and insistent. In contrast, customers who judge product features to be not competitive may simply (and quietly) become ex-customers. \\n\\tField intelligence derived from visits to customers, suppliers, and others; actions taken by competitors; and stories published in the media (as reported by sales, customer service, technical service, and others). \\n\\tThe impact on society, such as new legislation, extension of government regulation, and growth of product liability lawsuits. \\n\\tThe managerial hierarchy, such as the council, managers, supervisors, professional specialists, and project teams. \\n\\tThe workforce through informal ideas presented to supervisors, formal suggestions, ideas from circles, and so on. \\n\\tProposals relating to business processes. \\nEffect of the Organization-wide or Big Q Concept \\nBeginning in the 1980s and continuing for the near future, the scope of nominations for projects broadened considerably under the big Q concept. The breadth of the big Q concept is evident from the wide variety of projects that have already been tackled: \\n\\tImprove the precision of the sales forecast. \\n\\tReduce the cycle time for developing new products. \\n\\tIncrease the success rate in bidding for business. \\n\\tReduce the time required to fill customers’ orders. \\n\\tReduce the number of sales cancellations. \\n\\tReduce the errors in invoices. \\n\\tReduce the number of delinquent accounts. \\n\\tReduce the time required to recruit new employees. \\n\\tImprove the on-time arrival rate (for transportation services). \\n\\tReduce the time required to file for patents. \\nThe Nomination Process \\nNominations must come from human beings. Data systems are impersonal-they make no nominations. Various means are used to stimulate nominations for breakthrough projects: \\nCall for nominations. Letters or bulletin boards are used to invite all personnel to submit nominations, either through the chain of command or to a designated recipient, such as the secretary of the council. \\nMake the rounds. In this approach, specialists (such as engineers) are assigned to visit the various departments, talk with the key people, and secure their views and nominations. \\nThe council members themselves. They become a focal point for extensive data analyses and proposals. \\nBrainstorming meetings. These are organized for the specific purpose of making nominations. \\nWhatever the method used, it will produce the most nominations if it urges use of the big Q concept-the entire spectrum of activities, products, and processes. \\nNominations from the Employees at All Levels \\nThe workforce is potentially a source of numerous nominations. Workers have extensive residence in the workplace. They are exposed to many local cycles of activity. Through this exposure, they are well poised to identify the existence of problems and to theorize about their causes. As to the details of goings-on in the workplace, no one is better informed than the workforce. “That machine hasn’t seen a maintenance man for the last six months.” In addition, many workers are well poised to identify opportunities and to propose new ways. \\nWorkforce nominations consist mainly of local useful many projects along with proposals of a human relations nature. For such nominations, workers can supply useful theories of causes as well as practical proposals for remedies. For projects of a multifunctional nature, most workers are handicapped by their limited knowledge of the overall process and of the interactions among the steps that collectively make up the overall process. \\nIn some organizations, the solicitation of nominations from the workforce has implied that such nominations would receive top priority. The effect was that the workforce was deciding which projects the managers should tackle first. It should have been made clear that workers’ nominations must compete for priority with nominations from other sources. \\nJoint Projects with Suppliers and Customers \\nAll organizations buy goods and services from suppliers; over half the content of the finished product may come from suppliers. In earlier decades, it was common for customers to contend. The supplier should solve his problems. Now there is growing awareness that these problems require a partnership approach based on \\nEstablishing mutual trust \\nDefining customer needs as well as specifications \\nExchanging essential data \\nDirect communication at the technical level as well as the commercial level \\nProject Screening \\nCalls for nominations can produce large numbers of responses-numbers that are beyond the digestive capacity of the organization. In such cases, an essential further step is screening to identify those nominations that promise the most benefits for the effort expended. \\nTo start with a long list of nominations and end up with a list of agreed-upon projects requires an organized approach-an infrastructure and a methodology. The screening process is time-consuming, so the council usually delegates it to a secretariat, often the department. The secretariat screens the nominations-it judges the extent to which the nominations meet the criteria set out below. These judgments result in some preliminary decision-making. Some nominations are rejected. Others are deferred. The remainder is analyzed in greater depth to estimate potential benefits, resources needed, and so on. \\nThe councils and/or the secretariats have found it useful to establish criteria to be used during the screening process. Experience has shown that there is a need for two sets of criteria: \\nCriteria for choosing the first projects to be tackled by any of the project teams \\nCriteria for choosing projects thereafter \\nCriteria for Projects \\nDuring the beginning stages of project-by-project breakthrough, everyone is in a learning state. Projects are assigned to project teams, who are in training. Completing a project is a part of that training. Experience with such teams has evolved a broad set of criteria: \\nThe project should deal with a chronic problem-one that has been awaiting a solution for a long time. \\nThe project should be feasible. There should be a good likelihood of completing it within a few months. Feedback from organizations suggests that the most frequent reason for failure of the first project has been failure to meet the criterion of feasibility. \\nThe project should be significant. The end result should be sufficiently useful to merit attention and recognition. \\nThe results should be measurable, whether in money or in other significant terms. \\nThe first projects should be winners. \\nAdditional criteria to select projects are aimed at what will do the organization the most good:\\nReturn on investment. This factor has great weight and is decisive, all other things being equal. Projects that do not lend themselves to computing return on investment must rely for their priority on managerial judgment. \\nThe amount of potential breakthrough. One large project will take priority over several small ones. \\nUrgency. There may be a need to respond promptly to pressures associated with product safety, employee morale, and customer service. \\nEase of technological solution. Projects for which the technology is well developed will take precedence over projects that require research to discover the needed technology. \\nHealth of the product line. Projects involving thriving product lines will take precedence over projects involving obsolescent product lines. \\nProbable resistance to change. Projects that will meet a favorable reception take precedence over projects that may meet strong resistance, such as from the labor union or from a manager set in his or her ways. \\nMost organizations use a systematic approach to evaluate nominations relative to these criteria. This yields a composite evaluation that then becomes an indication of the relative priorities of the nominations. (For more detail and an example of a project selection matrix, see Chap. 12, Six Sigma: Breakthrough to in-Process Effectiveness.) \\nProject Selection \\nThe result of the screening process is a list of recommended projects in their order of priority. Each recommendation is supported by the available information on compatibility with the criteria and potential benefits, resources required, and so on. This list is commonly limited to matters in which the council has a direct interest. \\nThe council reviews the recommendations and makes the final determination on which projects are to be tackled. These projects then become an official part of the organization’s business. Other recommended projects are outside the scope of the direct interest of the council. Such projects are recommended to appropriate sub-councils, managers, and so on. None of the preceding prevents projects from being undertaken at local levels by supervisors or by the workforce. \\nVital Few and Useful Many \\nSome organizations completed many projects. Then, when questions were raised-“What have we gotten for all this effort?”-they were dismayed to learn that there was no noticeable effect on the bottom line. Investigation then showed that the reason could be traced to the process used for project selection. The projects actually selected had consisted of \\nFirefighting projects. These are special projects for getting rid of sporadic “spikes.” Such projects did not attack the chronic waste and hence, could not improve financial performance. (See Chap. 16, Root Cause Analysis Methods.) \\nUseful many projects. By definition, these have only a minor effect on financial performance but have great effect on human relations. \\nProjects for improving human relations. These can be quite effective in their field, but the financial results are usually not measurable. \\nTo achieve a significant effect on the bottom line requires selecting the “vital few” projects as well as the “useful many.” It is feasible to work on both, since different people are assigned to each. \\nThere is a school of thought emerging that contends that the key to market leadership is “tiny breakthroughs in a thousand places”-in other words, the useful many. Another school urges focus on the vital few. In my experience, neither of these schools has the complete answer. Both are needed-at the right time. \\nThe vital few projects are the major contributors to leadership and to the bottom line. The useful many projects are the major contributors to employee participation and to the quality of work life. Each is necessary; neither is sufficient. \\nThe vital few and useful many projects can be carried out simultaneously. Successful organizations have done just that by recognizing that while there are these two types of projects, they require the time of different categories of organization personnel. \\nCost Figures for Projects \\nTo meet the preceding criteria (especially that of return on investment) requires information on various costs: \\nThe cost of chronic waste associated with a given nomination \\nThe potential cost reduction if the project is successful \\nThe cost of the needed diagnosis and remedy \\nCosts versus Percent Deficiencies \\nIt is risky to judge priorities based solely on the percentage of deficiencies (errors, defects, and so on). On the face of it, when this percentage is low, the priority of the nomination also should be low. In some cases this is true, but in others it can be seriously misleading. \\nElephant-Sized and Bite-Sized Projects \\nThere is only one way to eat an elephant: bite by bite. Some projects are “elephant-sized”; that is, they cover so broad an area of activity that they must be subdivided into multiple “bite-sized” projects. In such cases, one project team can be assigned to “cut up the elephant.” Other teams are then assigned to tackle the resulting bite-sized projects. This approach shortens the time to complete the project, since the teams work concurrently. In contrast, use of a single team stretches the time out to several years. Frustration sets in, team membership changes due to attrition, the project drags, and morale declines. \\nA most useful tool for cutting up the elephant is the Pareto analysis. For an application, see the paper mill example earlier, under “Use of the Pareto Principle.” For elephant-sized projects, separate goal statements are prepared for the broad coordinating team and for each team assigned to a bite-sized project. \\nReplication and Cloning \\nSome organizations consist of multiple autonomous units that exhibit much commonality. A widespread example is the chains of retail stores, repair shops, hospitals, and so on. In such organizations, a breakthrough project that is carried out successfully in one operating unit logically becomes a nomination for application to other units. This is called cloning the project. \\nIt is quite common for the other units to resist applying the breakthrough to their operation. Some of this resistance is cultural in nature (not invented here, and so on). Other resistance may be due to real differences in operating conditions. For example, telephone exchanges perform similar functions for their customers. However, some serve mainly industrial customers, whereas others serve mainly residential customers. \\nUpper managers are wary of ordering autonomous units to clone breakthroughs that originated elsewhere. Yet cloning has advantages. Where feasible, it provides additional breakthroughs without the need to duplicate the prior work of diagnosis and design of remedy. \\nWhat has emerged is a process as follows: \\nProject teams are asked to include in their final report their suggestions as to sites that may be opportunities for cloning. \\nCopies of such final reports go to those sites. \\nThe decision of whether to clone is made by the sites. \\nHowever, the sites are required to make a response as to their disposition of the matter. This response is typically in one of three forms: \\n1.\\tWe have adopted the breakthrough. \\n2.\\tWe will adopt the breakthrough, but we must first adapt it to our conditions. \\n3.\\tWe are not able to adopt the breakthrough for the following reasons. \\nIn effect, this process requires the units to adopt the breakthrough or give reasons for not doing so. The units cannot just quietly ignore the recommendation. \\nA more subtle but familiar form of cloning is done through projects that have repetitive application over a wide variety of subject matter.
